This project started my web development career.
View the app [here](https://facecounter.herokuapp.com/)

Although this app started as a part of an [online course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/), I enjoyed making it so much that I decided I would really go for JavaScript - Web Development. Even if it was super hard for me at the time, I had so much fun that I redesigned the interface, added features so that the simple app made a little more sense to me, showcasing better what I have learned. I was so happy about the outcome and even until now, I think it still looks fine. (Bias, I know. Haha)

The code may be old but I still update this app sometimes, I even created a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/face_counter) lately as an accompaniment. Oops, I haven't told what this app does yet, for information on the features and technical this about the app, here are the Github repositories.
